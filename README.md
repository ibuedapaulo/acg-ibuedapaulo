## Time

Monday 2nd period, 10:25am - 12:10pm


## Course Description

Computer graphics is a technology to computationally represent objects' geometry, appearance and movement. This course is an introduction to the techniques generally seen in computer graphics. The aim of the course is to get familiar with applied mathematics such as linear algebra, vector analysis, partial differential equations, numerical analysis and optimization through the topics in computer graphics. There are Rust/Unity programming assignments to acquire research-oriented graphics programming skills such as shader programming and Git. 

Topics:
- Visualization of lines/trianges using rasterization/ray casting
- Parametric curves/surfaces
- Affine/homography transformation
- Volume representation and visualization
- Monte Carlo integration
- Continuous optimization (gradient/hessian based)
- Variational mesh deformation

## Grading

- 20% lecture attendance
  - Attendance is counted based on writing a secret keyword on LMS. The keyword is announced for each lecture.  
- 80% small assignments
  - see below

## Assignments

There are many small programming assignments. 
To do the assignments, you need to create your own copy of this repository through **GitHub Classroom**.  
These assignments need to be submitted using **pull request** functionality of the GitHub. 
Look at the following document.

- Late submission of an assignment is subject to grade deduction.
- Score each assignment will not be open soon (instructor needs to adjust weight of the score later).
- The assignments might not be graded soon.
